# Superstore Project

This project focuses on analyzing business data using SQL.

I started by downloading a Superstore dataset from Kaggle and converting it into a relational SQL database.

I wrote 10 SQL queries that explore different business areas, including sales performance, customer behavior, product categories, shipping times, and profit distribution.

Each query includes an insight to explain the results and suggest possible actions for the business.

The main goal of this project is to practice data analysis, identify patterns and trends, and provide valuable information for decision-making.

## Skills Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Joins, aggregation, filtering, subqueries
- Data analysis and business insight writing
